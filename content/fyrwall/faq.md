# FAQ

**Is FYRwall really free?**
Yes. Apache-2.0 with Commons Clause: use, modify, self-host freely and
embed it inside larger products. What nobody may do is sell FYRwall itself
as a standalone paid product.

**How is this different from Cockpit/Webmin?**
FYRwall is firewall-focused with transactional safety: conflict detection,
lockout prevention, restore points and verified rollback. General-purpose
panels manage many things; FYRwall does one thing safely.

**Does it work behind nginx/Caddy?**
Yes. Set trusted_proxies and your domain. The GUI enforces the configured
Host when domain binding is on.

**Can it manage many servers?**
Yes. Remote agents dial out to the central server, enroll with single-use
tokens and per-agent credentials, and synchronize rules, health, ownership,
drift hashes, inventory, policy revisions, and command results.

**Can the central FYRwall server manage its own firewall too?**
Yes. Install an agent on the same host as the server, then treat that machine
as another target. Keep the web/API process
unprivileged; only the narrow agent boundary may perform firewall
operations. FYRwall should never silently inject an agent.

**Is fleet synchronization realtime?**
Yes, using authenticated outbound long polling. Agents report ordered state
revisions and hashes; commands usually arrive within one polling round trip.
Pending results survive agent restarts, while stale deliveries are reconciled.
mTLS client certificates rotate automatically before expiry and can be revoked
per agent from the Fleet page.

**What if the agent dies?**
The web server stays up, shows the agent offline, disables writes and gives
recovery steps. Firewall rules on the host are untouched.

**Does it send data anywhere?**
No. Telemetry, analytics and update checks are off by default. When you
enable update checks, the only request is one manifest GET.

**Which distros?**
Debian/Ubuntu, RHEL/Rocky/Alma, Fedora, SUSE, Arch, Alpine, Void, Gentoo -
anything Go binaries run on. glibc and musl. Seven CPU architectures.

**Can I break my firewall with it?**
The product is designed so that is hard: risky changes are blocked, every
apply has a snapshot + verify + rollback, and safe-apply timers undo
connectivity-breaking changes automatically.

**Uninstall cleanly?**
    fyrwall uninstall
    # or from a repo checkout:
    sudo sh packaging/uninstall.sh --all --purge
Removes binaries, units, user, data, logs. Your firewall rules are never
touched by FYRwall install or uninstall.

**Can I use FYRwall commercially?**
Yes, with one rule. You may embed FYRwall as a feature inside a larger
product or service, including paid ones. You may not sell FYRwall itself:
no charging for the software, no paid managed hosting of FYRwall alone, no
paid support whose value is FYRwall itself.

**Where do I put the license notice?**
Keep the LICENSE file and attribution in your distribution. If you
redistribute, your license notice must include the Commons Clause condition
alongside Apache-2.0.
