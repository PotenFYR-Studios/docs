# Security Model & Limitations

What Vigil guarantees, what it can't, and why it fails the way it fails.

## The model

Vigil is a **policy gate between an AI agent's tools and your filesystem**. Every tool action an agent attempts - read, write, search, exec, net - is evaluated against a ruleset before (hooks) or around (shim) execution, or observed after the fact (audit).

Three layers, honest about coverage:

| Layer | Blocks? | Covers | Weakness |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **Hooks** | ✅ | Hook-capable agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, OpenCode, Hermes) | Only what the agent reports through its hook API |
| **Shim** | ✅ (wraps) | Any command, explicitly wrapped | Only commands routed through `vigil shim` |
| **Audit** | ❌ (warns) | Any process touching watched areas | Detection after the fact, not prevention |

**Hooks cover hookable agents; audit and shim are for the rest.** There is no layer that blocks an arbitrary, unhooked, unshimmed process from reading a file - that's what OS permissions are for. Vigil complements them; it doesn't replace them.

## What the core ruleset protects

Sensitive areas denied out of the box include `.env` files, secrets directories,
SSH/GnuPG/AWS directories, private keys, credentials files, cloud and CI/CD
credentials, package-manager credentials, application configuration, containers
and cluster manifests, password-manager databases, crypto wallets, system account
files, shell history, agent state, cloud metadata endpoints, private networks,
and destructive, persistence, escalation, recon, exfiltration, and database
maintenance commands. Repository metadata is observed with a warning. See the
[Rules reference](rules.md#built-in-policy-coverage) for the exact list and
severities.

## Fail-open, deliberately

**On daemon error, ruleset load error, or hook malfunction, Vigil allows the action** (exit code `0`). Rationale:

- Vigil sits in the critical path of every agent tool call. A guard that can fail closed can take your whole workflow down - a corrupted rule file or a dead daemon would make every agent useless.
- The threat model is *an AI agent fumbling toward your secrets*, not a determined attacker. An attacker who can disable Vigil can also delete it; fail-closed gains nothing against that adversary.

The cost: transient daemon failures are silent allowances. Audit logging records what it can; the TUI surfaces daemon health. If your threat model weighs availability lower than exposure, keep `general.mode = "audit"` off and treat Vigil as one layer among OS permissions, disk encryption, and secret managers.

## Verdict and exit code contract

| Verdict | Meaning | Hook exit code |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| `allow` | Permitted (explicit or default) | `0` |
| `deny` | Blocked before execution | `2` |
| `ask` | Deferred to the agent/user for confirmation | `3` |
| `warn` | Permitted, recorded, flagged in the TUI | `0` |
| `mask` | Permitted with sensitive content redacted | `0` |

First matching rule wins; file order is priority; no match allows (rule `default`). In audit mode every `deny` demotes to `warn`.

## Known limitations

- **Rule matching is pattern-based.** Globs and regexes can be evaded by exotic path encodings or command obfuscation. The exec rules accept known false negatives (e.g. `rm --help /`) and some read-overblocking (`sudo cat /etc/passwd` matches the sudo-write rule) - documented trade-offs in [`rules/core.toml`](../rules/core.toml).
- **Masking is best-effort content filtering**, not a DLP product. Novel secret formats not covered by the six pattern families pass through; custom patterns and extensions narrow the gap.
- **`net` scope is command-line level** (e.g. metadata endpoint hosts, curl-pipe-shell), not a firewall. It does not intercept arbitrary network syscalls.
- **Agent coverage is only as good as hook support.** A future agent without hooks gets audit + shim, which record and wrap but cannot block mid-flight.
- **Local trust boundary.** Vigil runs as your user with your permissions. It does not defend against malware running as you, only against agent tool actions.
