``` </div> --- ## 🔎 Overview Vigil is a local guard for AI coding agents: it sits between your agent and your filesystem and blocks reads, writes, searches, and commands that touch sensitive areas - `.env` files, secrets directories, SSH and AWS credentials, private keys, crypto wallets, system paths. Hooks are auto-installed for agents that support them; a filesystem-watch audit mode and the `vigil shim` wrapper cover everything else. Because it guards the tool actions on your machine, it is **proxy-proof**: it works identically behind any LLM API proxy or router (9router, LiteLLM, corporate gateways) - the model never sees what the tool never touched. Built by **PotenFYR Studios**. --- ## 🧭 Contents - [Core Guarantees](#core-guarantees)

- [License](#license) --- ## Core Guarantees - Every tool call is evaluated against the ruleset **before it executes**, with a strict exit-code contract: `0` allow, `2` deny, `3` ask.
- Verdicts are local and synchronous. Hook execution never waits on the daemon; a dead or restarting daemon never delays or breaks your agent.
- On daemon or ruleset error the hook **fails open** - a broken guard must never break your workflow. Calibration mode (`audit`) demotes every `deny` to `warn`, so nothing is ever blocked while you tune rules.
- Rules layer deterministically: built-in core ruleset → `~/.vigil/rules/*.toml` → `./.vigil/rules/*.toml`, overriding by rule id, so your local rules always win.
- Masking is opt-in and preserves a 4-character prefix so you can still tell which secret was matched - and it never emits more than that.
- Vigil inspects local tool actions, not network traffic. Which LLM API, proxy, or router you use is irrelevant: same rules, same verdicts, everywhere. --- ## ✨ Features ### Enforcement, three layers deep
- **Hooks (block before it runs)** - `vigil setup` detects installed agents and wires their native hook systems automatically. Every read, write, search, exec, and net action is checked first.
- **Audit watcher (warn, never block)** - a filesystem watcher records sensitive-area access by any process; for agents without hooks.
- **`vigil shim` (wrap anything)** - `vigil shim <command>…` puts arbitrary commands under the same rule evaluation.
- Enforcement where possible, visibility everywhere - no agent gets a free pass; only enforcement depth differs. ### Rules
- Built-in core ruleset: identity and cloud credentials, CI/CD material, package registries, application configuration, containers, password managers, wallets, shell history, agent state, system paths - plus destructive, escalation, persistence, recon, exfiltration, database mutation, and private-network guards.
- Rule schema with severities and priorities; first match wins, most specific first.
- Built-in coverage now includes cloud/CI credentials, database configs and dumps, browser credential stores, system identity writes, agent config tampering, reverse shells, base64 shell pipelines, package-script exfiltration, and history/wipe attempts.
- Remote rule sync from the community feed on boot and `vigil reload`; `vigil rules update` refreshes on demand.
- Override any built-in rule by id from `~/.vigil/rules/` or `./.vigil/rules/`. ### Masking (opt-in, off by default)
- AWS keys, GitHub PATs, OpenAI keys, JWTs, private keys, and env values redacted in tool output, with a 4-character prefix preserved.
- Reusable custom patterns via `rules/patterns.toml` and extensions. ### Daemon, tray and updates
- `vigil daemon` owns event persistence, configurable age/count retention, a local IPC bus, tray integration, and update checks. Autostart and tray are opt-out config keys.
- `vigil update` self-updates the binary (semver check plus commits-behind, surfaced in the tray and TUI). ### Live report
- `vigil tui` is the default command: every verdict, who triggered it, which agent, and why - rule id and severity included - with a scrollable event log, export, and `--report` for SIEM-style handoff. ### Extensions
- Drop a `manifest.toml` into `~/.vigil/extensions/<name>/` to add your own rules, masking patterns, and event hooks. No fork required. --- ## 🛡️ Security Model | Layer | Control |
|---|---|
| Hook path | Local, synchronous evaluation; exit codes `0`/`2`/`3`; fail-open only on daemon/ruleset error |
| Rule engine | Layered rulesets, id-based override, first-match-wins, severity tagging |
| Rules supply chain | Community feed sync, checksum-free but id-addressable - local files always override remote |
| Sensitive data | Masking opt-in, 4-char prefix cap, patterns never log matched secret bodies |
| Coverage | Hooks (enforce) + audit watcher + shim - universal visibility, best-effort enforcement |
| Failure mode | Audit mode demotes deny→warn; daemon unavailability never blocks tool calls | Full threat model and honest limits: [docs/security-model.md](docs/security-model.md). --- ## 🧱 Repository Layout ```

``` --- ## 🚀 Install OS and arch are detected and the download is checksum-verified: ```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PotenFYR-Studios/VigilFYR/master/install.sh | sh
``` Windows (PowerShell): ```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PotenFYR-Studios/VigilFYR/master/install.ps1 | iex
``` The binary lands in `~/.local/bin` (add it to `PATH` if the installer says so). Release archives cover **Linux** (GNU and musl; x86_64, ARM64, ARMv7, RISC-V64), **macOS** (x86_64 and ARM64), and **Windows** (x64 and ARM64), each with a `.sha256` sidecar. ### Quick Start ```sh
# Interactive wizard: OS check, agent auto-detect, per-agent mode,
# extra protected paths, masking opt-in, autostart + tray
vigil setup # Or zero prompts, all defaults
vigil setup --defaults # Check what your rules actually are
vigil rules list
vigil rules path # Live report
vigil tui
``` That's it. Agents you had installed are now guarded; `vigil tui` shows the live report. --- ## ⚙️ Configuration Config lives at `~/.vigil/config.toml`. A missing file means defaults. Read and write keys without editing the file: ```sh
vigil config get masking.enabled # false
vigil config set general.mode audit # calibrate without blocking
vigil config set agents.codex enforce
vigil config set masking.enabled true
``` | Key | Default | What it does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `general.enabled` | `true` | Master switch |
| `general.mode` | `enforce` | `enforce` or `audit` (audit never blocks) |
| `daemon.autostart` | `true` | Start the daemon on login |
| `daemon.tray` | `true` | Show the tray icon (update checks live here too) |
| `masking.enabled` | `false` | Opt-in sensitive-data masking |
| `masking.patterns` | all built-in | Empty list selects all 33 provider, token, URI, assignment, and entropy patterns |
| `rules.remote_update` | `true` | Sync community rules on boot / `vigil reload` |
| `agents.<id>` | `claude-code=enforce` | Per-agent mode: `off`, `audit`, `enforce` | Rules layering: built-in core ruleset → `~/.vigil/rules/*.toml` → `./.vigil/rules/*.toml` (later files override earlier ones **by rule id**; within a file, order is priority - first match wins). `vigil reload` applies everything without a restart.

vigil launch the TUI (default command)
vigil tui [--once] [--report] live report; --once prints one snapshot, --report prints counters and retained events for SIEM
vigil setup [--defaults] interactive (or promptless) setup wizard
vigil daemon [--no-tray] run the background daemon
vigil rules list|path inspect the active ruleset
vigil rules test <action> [path] [--command <cmd>] [--agent <id>] dry-run the effective policy without logging an event
vigil doctor read-only setup, policy, retention and event health check
vigil rules update refresh the remote community feed
vigil reload reload rules + config without restart
vigil config get|set read/write config keys
vigil agents list|install|remove manage per-agent hooks
vigil shim <command>… run a command under Vigil's wrapper
vigil extension manage extensions
vigil update [--check] self-update the binary
``` (`vigil intercept` is the internal hook entrypoint your agents call; you never invoke it by hand.) --- ### Updating Vigil tells you when a new release ships (update checks ride along with the tray; opt out with `daemon.tray = false` / `vigil daemon --no-tray`): ```sh
vigil update --check # compare installed vs latest release
vigil update # verified download + checksum check + swap
``` Re-running the curl one-liner is always a safe in-place upgrade; your `~/.vigil` config, rules and extensions are never touched. --- ## 📦 Releases | Event | What happens |
|---|---|
| push to `master` / `feat/**` | CI: fmt + clippy + tests on Linux, macOS, Windows |
| push to `master` | Docs site auto-deploys to GitHub Pages; snake animation refreshes |
| push to `master` with the same version | portable archives and native installers are rebuilt, release notes refresh, and old release assets are replaced |
| version tag `vX.Y.Z` | Full release: portable archives for Linux (GNU + musl), macOS, and Windows (x64 + ARM64), plus `.deb`, `.pkg`, and `.msi` installers and SHA256SUMS | Same version, new commits: the rolling tag and release assets are refreshed automatically. Bumped version: the same pipeline publishes the next tagged release. --- ## 🧠 Architecture ```text ┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ vigil daemon │ │ ruleset · decision engine · event log │ └───────▲──────────────▲──────────────▲────┘ │ │ │ ┌─────────────┘ │ └────────────┐ │ │ │ ┌────────┴───────┐ ┌─────────┴────────┐ ┌─────────┴────────┐ │ agent hooks │ │ audit watcher │ │ vigil shim │ │ (native, block │ │ (fs watch, warn │ │ (command wrapper,│ │ before it runs)│ │ never blocks) │ │ works with any │ └────────────────┘ └──────────────────┘ │ CLI agent) │ └──────────────────┘
``` Hook verdicts are computed locally and synchronously - the daemon is a reporter, not a gatekeeper. Every matched event lands in the event log with the agent, action, rule id, and severity, visible in `vigil tui`. --- ## 🧩 Extensions Ship your own rules, patterns, and event hooks as a drop-in folder: ```toml
# ~/.vigil/extensions/my-team/manifest.toml
[extension]
name = "my-team"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Company-internal rules" # files alongside the manifest are picked up:
# rules/*.toml - same schema as the core ruleset
# patterns/*.toml - reusable masking patterns
# hooks/*.toml - event hooks

Works wherever Rust stable builds and the agent exists: Linux (systemd user units for autostart), macOS (launchd), Windows (autostart + tray). Portable targets: Linux GNU and musl on x86_64, ARM64, ARMv7, and RISC-V64; macOS and Windows on x86_64/ARM64 and x64/ARM64. Vigil is fully local: no telemetry, no cloud calls - the only outbound requests are the rule feed and update checks, both configurable off. --- ## 📜 License Vigil is licensed under **Apache-2.0 with Commons Clause**. - Free to use, study, modify, self-host and redistribute
