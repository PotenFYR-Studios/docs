# OrbyNode Documentation

Welcome to the OrbyNode documentation. OrbyNode is the self-hosted control
plane for coding agents: persistent terminal agents, real PTYs, files, Git,
tasks, services and machine state in one daemon.

## Architecture decision records

ADRs live in [adr/](adr/) and capture substantial architecture decisions.
Notable:

- [ADR 001](adr/001-daemon-architecture.md), daemon-centric architecture
- [ADR 021](adr/021-herdr-parity-web-workspaces.md). Herdr-parity web workspaces and crash recovery
